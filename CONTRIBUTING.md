##### Work on local

You can work on your local project with this package. All you have to do is replace the version part of @perawallet/onramp in the package.json file with "file:path/onramp" like this.

```json
"@perawallet/onramp": "file:../onramp"
```

After doing this, you can run `npm run dev` and in this way, you can see the changes you have made to the package simultaneously.
